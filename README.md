# Pacman-Reinforcement
Implementing reinforcement algorithms such as value iteration and Q-Learning for Gridworld as well as a robot crawler and Pacman.

Files that were edited: valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py, analysis.py

I'd recommend looking at project3.pdf to become familiarized with the commands in order to run the code.
